Pokémon Adventures - Red Chapter's Beta 13 Obtainable Pokémon Guide
This guide was started by Lunos on December 26th, 2017.
 
The order that I decided to stick with for this list, is the order of maps as they show up.
Plot related events take priority which is the reason why I've put the Routes 24 and 25 before the Route 5, for example.
